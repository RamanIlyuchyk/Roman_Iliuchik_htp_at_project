Feature: Finding users
Scenario Outline: Finding users by username

Given I start finding by <index> predicate
When I get a response from a web service
And I form a known <resultName> result
Then I validate the web service response

Examples:
| index | resultName      |
| 0     | "ALL_USERS"     |
| 1     | "PARTIAL_SHORT" |
| 2     | "FULL_SHORT"    |
| 3     | "PARTIAL_LONG"  |
| 4     | "FULL_LONG"     |
